# Data Source

This project does not store any local dataset.

Stock price data is loaded automatically using the `yfinance` library when the notebook runs. 
This ensures the analysis always uses the most recent available market data and avoids sharing large or restricted files.

If you want to run the project:
- Open the notebook in /notebooks
- Run the cells
- The data will download automatically
