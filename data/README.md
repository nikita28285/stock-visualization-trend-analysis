# Stock Visualization & Trend Analysis

This project analyzes nearly 20 years of historical stock data and visualizes price trends over time.  
It focuses on helping users understand market behaviour — not predicting future prices.

Data is loaded automatically using the `yfinance` library each time the notebook runs, so the analysis always stays updated.

If you want to run the project:
- Open the notebook in /notebooks
- Run the cells
- The data will download automatically

##  Objectives

- Understand how stock prices move over long periods  
- Visualize patterns such as growth, dips, and volatility  
- Compare closing, opening, high, and low values  
- Support data-driven observation (without forecasting)

---

## 📊 Features

- Load historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance  
- Time-series trend visualization  
- Line charts for price movement  
- Comparison of multiple price metrics  
- Clean, reproducible Jupyter Notebook workflow  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning (LSTM)

Along with visualization, I experimented with an **LSTM Neural Network** for learning purposes.

**Purpose**

- Understand how sequence models handle time-series data  
- Compare model behaviour vs real market trends  

> Note: This project focuses mainly on visualization and learning — not full production forecasting (yet).
